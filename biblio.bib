	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the role of thermodynamics, and in particular, entropy, for the development of economics within the last 150 years. The use of entropy has not only led to a significant increase in economic knowledge, but also to the emergence of such scientific disciplines as econophysics, complexity economics and quantum economics. Nowadays, an interesting phenomenon can be observed; namely, that rapid progress in economics is being made outside the mainstream. The first significant achievement was the emergence of entropy economics in the early 1970s, which introduced the second law of thermodynamics to considerations regarding production processes. In this way, not only was ecological economics born but also an entropy-based econometric approach developed. This paper shows that non-extensive cross-entropy econometrics is a valuable complement to traditional econometrics as it explains phenomena based on power-law probability distribution and enables econometric model estimation for non-ergodic ill-behaved (troublesome) inverse problems. Furthermore, the entropy economics has accelerated the emergence of modern econophysics and complexity economics. These new directions of research have led to many interesting discoveries that usually contradict the claims of conventional economics. Econophysics has questioned the efficient market hypothesis, while complexity economics has shown that markets and economies function best near the edge of chaos. Quantum economics has already appeared on the horizon, which recognizes money as a fundamental measurement device in the economy. The development of these sciences may indicate the need to reformulate all mainstream economics from its foundations.},

	abstract = {In this paper a comparative, coarse grained, entropy data analysis of multi-scale log-returns distribution, produced by an ideal “optimal trader” and one thousand “noise traders” performing “bucket shop” trading, by following four different financial daily indices, is presented. A sole optimal trader is assigned to each one of these four analyzed markets, DJIA, IPC, Nikkei and DAX. Distribution of differential entropies of the corresponding multi-scale log-returns of the optimal and noise traders are calculated. Kullback-Leiber distances between the different optimal traders returns distributions are also calculated and results discussed. We show that the entropy of returns distribution of optimal traders for each analyzed market indeed reaches minimum values with respect to entropy distribution of noise traders and we measure this distance in σ units for each analyzed market. We also include a discussion on stationarity of the introduced multi-scale log-returns observable. Finally, a practical application of the obtained results related with ranking markets by their entropy measure as calculated here is presented.},

	annote = {simulacion de cuatro indices financieros, con 1000 “inversionistas” estandars (no informados) bajo el modelo “bucket shop”. Esta simulacion es tambien aplicada a un inversionista ideal, buen informado y racional.

En este articulo se estudia un caso simple del mercado “bucket shop”. La asunpcion es que la informacion de precios es conocida por todos los agentes.

Se calculo la distribucion del a entropia de todos los agentes de manera que se puede calcular la entropia promedio. De este modp, se puede medir la diferenca entre el inversionista ideal.

Es tambien calculado el tiepo de evolucion de la entropia de retorno para  los cuatro mercados estudiados.

Aqui se define un inversionista racional como un participante en el mercado que con conocimiento de informacion sobre dicho mercado. Dicha informacion le permite tener ventaja y un mejor rendimiento en el mercado, e.g., Un trabajador de amazon que sabe por una comunicacion interna de la empresa que habra unq nueva serie con Brad Pitt. Este trabajador recibio esta informacion un mes antes del estreno. Este trabajador compra acciones de amazon Prime por que piensa que Prime tendra mas suscriptores, y como consequencia, la accion podria incrementar de precio.
Un inversionista no racional es el caso contrario,  es un participante en em mercado que no tiene infomacion antes de participar. En esta categoria podemos clasificar los inversionistas que siguen las recomedaciones de algoritmos de prediccion de precios (de tipo machine learning). Los inversionistas que malinterpretan la inforacion son tambien catalogados como inversionistas no racionales.
En este articulo los invercionistas son considerados como entidades independientes. No inteccionan entre si, no intercambien informacion ni dinero.
El inversionista optimo vende y compra en el mejor momento para maximizar los “retornos”.
Esta modelizacion no es un similacion multiagente (donde los agentes intercambien informacion entre si).



Lo retornos utilizados por felix son dependientes del tiempo Treturns o son daily returns??

	abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

	abstract = {We present a symmetry analysis of the distribution of variations of different financial indices, by means of a statistical procedure developed by the authors based on a symmetry statistic by Einmahl and Mckeague. We applied this statistical methodology to financial uninterrupted daily trends returns and to other derived observable. In our opinion, to study distributional symmetry, trends returns offer more advantages than the commonly used daily financial returns; the two most important being: 1) Trends returns involve sampling over different time scales and 2) By construction, this variable time series contains practically the same number of non-negative and negative entry values. We also show that these time multi-scale returns display distributional bi-modality. Daily financial indices analyzed in this work, are the Mexican IPC, the American DJIA, DAX from Germany and the Japanese Market index Nikkei, covering a time period from 11-08-1991 to 06-30-2017. We show that, at the time scale resolution and significance considered in this paper, it is almost always feasible to find an interval of possible symmetry points containing one most plausible symmetry point denoted by C. Finally, we study the temporal evolution of C showing that this point is seldom zero and responds with sensitivity to extreme market events.},

	abstract = {In financial time series there are time periods in which market indices values or assets prices increase or decrease monotonically. We call those events “price runs”, “elementary uninterrupted trends” or just “uninterrupted trends”. In this paper we study the distribution of the duration of uninterrupted trends for the daily indices DJIA, NASDAQ, IPC and Nikkei 225 during the period of time from 10/30/1978 to 08/07/2020 and we compare the simple geometric statistical model with p = 1 2 consistent with the EMH to the empirical data. By a fitting procedure, it is found that the geometric distribution with parameter p = 1 2 provides a good model for uninterrupted trends of short and medium duration for the more mature markets; however, longest duration events still need to be statistically characterized. Estimated values of the parameter p were also obtained and confirmed by calculating the mean value of p fluctuations from empirical data. Additionally, the observed trend duration distributions for the different studied markets are compared over time by means of the Anderson-Darling (AD) test, to the expected geometric distribution with parameter p = 1 2 and to a geometric distribution with a free parameter p, making possible to assess and compare different market geometric behavior for different dates as well as to measure the fraction of time runs duration from studied markets are consistent with the geometric distribution with p = 1 2 and in parametric free way.},

	abstract = {Present-day securities trading is dominated by fully automated algorithms. These algorithmic systems are characterized by particular forms of knowledge risk (adverse effects relating to the use or absence of certain forms of knowledge) and principal-agent problems (goal conflicts and information asymmetries arising from the delegation of decision-making authority). Where automated trading systems used to be based on human-defined rules, increasingly, machine-learning (ML) techniques are being adopted to produce machine-generated strategies. Drawing on 213 interviews with market participants involved in automated trading, this study compares the forms of knowledge risk and principal-agent relations characterizing both human-defined and ML-based automated trading systems. It demonstrates that certain forms of ML-based automated trading lead to a change in knowledge risks, particularly concerning dramatically changing market settings, and that they are characterized by a lack of insight into how and why trading rules are being produced by the ML systems. This not only intensifies but also reconfigures principal-agent problems in financial markets.},

	ABSTRACT = {The high quantile estimation of heavy tailed distributions has many important applications. There are theoretical difficulties in studying heavy tailed distributions since they often have infinite moments. There are also bias issues with the existing methods of confidence intervals (CIs) of high quantiles. This paper proposes a new estimator for high quantiles based on the geometric mean. The new estimator has good asymptotic properties as well as it provides a computational algorithm for estimating confidence intervals of high quantiles. The new estimator avoids difficulties, improves efficiency and reduces bias. Comparisons of efficiencies and biases of the new estimator relative to existing estimators are studied. The theoretical are confirmed through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the applications on two real-world examples are provided.},
